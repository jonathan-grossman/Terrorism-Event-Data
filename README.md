This is the online appendix for the article [&quot;The Quantitative Study of Terrorist Events: Challenges and Opportunities&quot;](https://oxfordre.com/criminology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-568) by Jonathan Grossman and Ami Pedahzur, which was published in the _Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Criminology and Criminal Justice_ in April 2020. 

This repository contains the following files:

[**Database.csv**](https://github.com/jonathan-grossman/Terrorism-Event-Data/blob/master/Database.csv): the project&#39;s database as a CSV file.

[**Methodological\_Companion.pdf**](https://github.com/jonathan-grossman/Terrorism-Event-Data/blob/master/Methodological_Companion.pdf): A methodological companion explaining our data collection procedure and introducing the project&#39;s codebook.

[**Replication\_Material\_Verification\_Links.pdf**](https://github.com/jonathan-grossman/Terrorism-Event-Data/blob/master/Replication_Material_Verification_Links.pdf): The list of links that we have used in our attempts to verify terrorist events in the CPOST and GTD terrorism databases. Many of these links require University of Texas electronic identification. Others have become broken since the time of validation. However, we do maintain a copy of each and every entry on the list. While we cannot share these files online for copyright reasons, we will provide them upon request.
